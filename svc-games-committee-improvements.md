## **APPROVED IDEAS** ✅

### Visual & Interactive Elements
- **Countdown timer** to Super Bowl LX (2026) and FIFA World Cup 2026
- **Interactive maps** showing planned events/venues across Silicon Valley
- Fix broken placeholder images

### Content That Tells a Story
- **Past success showcases** - what cool stuff has the committee done before?
  - *Need to research/ask chamber about previous activations*
  - *Possible examples: local business partnerships during other events, community watch parties, economic development wins*

### The Game Changer: Social Media Templates 🔥
- **Template library** for members who sign up
- Pre-made social posts, graphics, flyers
- Branded materials they can customize and share
- This could be a huge membership perk!

### Nice-to-Haves (If Data Available)
- Member count display
- Partner logos (when they get some)

## **REJECTED IDEAS** ❌
- Video content
- Image galleries  
- Event calendar (not enough events to justify)
- Progress tracker (vague metrics)
- Economic impact data (too hard to get)
- Testimonials (boring)

## **THEME BRAINSTORMING** 🎨

*Need to develop the visual/brand theme...*

## **QUESTIONS TO ASK THE CHAMBER**
- What events has this committee actually organized before?
- Do they have any metrics from previous sports-related activities?
- Who are their most engaged current members we could spotlight?
- What partnerships already exist with venues/cities/businesses?

## **WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE** 🎯

### The Big Picture Goals:
1. **"CELEBRATE/PLAY/EAT/STAY/BENEFIT LOCALLY"** - Keep visitor dollars in Silicon Valley instead of SF
2. **"Promoting One Silicon Valley"** - Unite the region as a single competitive destination  
3. **"Turn global moments into local wins"** - Convert massive international attention into local business opportunities

### Their 4 Core Activities:
1. **Event Coordination Hub** - Help businesses/communities organize watch parties, food fests, cultural celebrations
2. **Promotional Platform** - "The Guide to The Games" magazine to promote local businesses to visitors
3. **Networking/Partnership Building** - Monthly roundtables to connect businesses with each other and city officials
4. **Information/Resource Sharing** - Dos/Don'ts toolkit, updates from Santa Clara & Bay Area Host Committee

### What Success Looks Like For Them:
- Local businesses get more customers during the games
- Silicon Valley becomes known as THE place to experience the games (not just SF)
- Community events happen across the region (not just at the stadium)
- Businesses work together instead of competing

## **WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DELIVER** (from their internal image)
The image shows 8 concrete deliverables:
1. **The Games Magazine Guide** - comprehensive guide to games and activities
2. **Event Map** - tourist-style map with highlighted areas  
3. **Games Calendar** - master events calendar
4. **Coalition Updates** - regular community coalition meetings and updates
5. **Global Promotion** - marketing and social media reach across California and worldwide
6. **Meet the Legends** - connecting with champions and icons of the region
7. **Visit Silicon Valley** - attracting visitors to Silicon Valley instead of San Francisco
8. **Games & Celebrations Hub** - public webpage for where to stay, eat, and play during the Games

## **THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THEIR CURRENT PAGE** 
The website is all fluffy mission statements, but this image shows they actually have CONCRETE DELIVERABLES! The page should lead with "Join and get access to these 8 things" instead of philosophical rambling about "empowering communities."

## **THE PLAN: Two-Pronged Approach** 🚀

### Option 1: Single Page Replacement 
- Replace their current wordy page with a clean, benefit-focused design
- Lead with the 8 concrete deliverables from their image
- Clear calls-to-action and next steps
- Mobile-optimized and streamlined
- Can link to the full site at the bottom

### Option 2: Full Dedicated React Site
- Multi-page experience with all our cool ideas
- Countdown timers, interactive maps, member spotlights
- Social media template library
- Event submission system
- Member portal vibes
- This is the "dream version" wireframe

## **DELIVERABLES** ✅ COMPLETED!

1. **Single HTML page** (`single-page.html`) - drop-in replacement for current page
   - Live countdown timer to Super Bowl LX
   - All 8 benefits clearly presented 
   - 3-step join process
   - Mobile responsive
   - Links to full site concept

2. **Full React site** (`src/` folder) - wireframe/prototype showing what's possible
